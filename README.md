**`emissary` is a lightweight and embeddable [I2P](https://i2p.net/) router**

![UI](docs/router-ui.webp)

### Features

* Transports:
  * NTCP2
  * SSU2
* Client protocols:
  * I2CP
  * SAMv3
* Proxies:
  * HTTP
  * SOCKSv5
* I2PControl (Proposal 170):
  * JSON-RPC 2.0 API over TLS
  * RouterInfo inspection with live event metrics and explicit unavailable responses where Emissary has no canonical source
  * AddressBook administration
  * TunnelManager configuration
  * ClientServicesInfo

Proposal 170 administrative CRUD and the exact API surface are implemented. M065 adds
I2PControl-owned listener/accepted-stream lifecycle primitives and deterministic runtime-option
validation for future tunnel families; it does not promote any additional tunnel type to a real
production backend. Tunnel data planes and inspection sources that Emissary does not own remain
explicit unsupported/unavailable behavior. See
[`docs/i2pcontrol/proposal-170-support.md`](docs/i2pcontrol/proposal-170-support.md).

### Directory layout

* `emissary-core/` - I2P protocol implementation as an asynchronous library
* `emissary-util/` - `emissary-core`-related utilities, such as runtime implementations and reseeder
* `emissary-cli/` - `tokio`-based I2P router implementation

### Usage

1) Install from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/emissary-cli): `cargo install emissary-cli`
2) Build from sources: `cargo build --release`

Router installs its files under `$HOME/.emissary`, automatically reseeds over HTTPS on first boot and creates a default configuration. For instructions on how to browse and host eepsites, use torrents, or chat on Irc2P, visit [documentation](https://eepnet.github.io/emissary/).
