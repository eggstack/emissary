# Proposal 170 AddressBook Administrative API

Status: closed against the pinned Proposal 170 revision

This document describes the Proposal 170 AddressBook API for Emissary's
I2PControl service and its runtime ownership boundary.

## Overview

The AddressBook API provides administrative management of four independent
address books, a subscription set, and a configuration map. The four book
identities remain independent at the API boundary, while successful entry
mutations are committed by the running runtime `AddressBookHandle` and are
immediately visible to normal destination lookup.

Runtime precedence is unchanged: private, local, router, then published. A
hostname collision across books is rejected instead of changing the router's
existing resolution policy. The downloaded hosts source remains the published
runtime source.

Canonical Proposal 170 requests use one `AddressBook` method and select exactly
one mode. The linked Java reference implementation returns operation details
inside the JSON-RPC `result` object, so Emissary uses
`result: {success, message}` for all three mutation modes. The proposal's
top-level `success` example is treated as an inconsistent example, not a
second canonical envelope.

### Canonical entry mutation

```json
{
  "Type": "private",
  "Hostname": "example.i2p",
  "Destination": "base64-destination",
  "Delete": false
}
```

`Type` is exactly `private`, `local`, `router`, or `published`.
`Hostname` and `Destination` are required for entry operations. Presence of
`Delete` selects deletion regardless of its value; without it, the entry is
added or replaced.

### Canonical subscription/configuration modes

```json
{"SetSubscriptions": ["https://example.i2p/hosts.txt"]}
{"SetConfig": {"updateInterval": "3600"}}
```

These modes are handled inside `AddressBook`; they are not separate canonical
methods. Existing action-style and separate-method forms remain compatibility
extensions and cannot be mixed with canonical parameters.

## Methods

### Compatibility action-style AddressBook

The `AddressBook` method performs CRUD operations on one of four administrative address books.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `book` | string | yes | One of: `private`, `local`, `router`, `published` |
| `request` | string | yes | One of: `List`, `Lookup`, `Add`, `Update`, `Delete` |
| `name` | string | for Lookup/Add/Update/Delete | Hostname (e.g., `example.i2p`) |
| `value` | string | for Add/Update | I2P destination (base64) |

**Operations:**

- **List**: Returns all entries in the specified book as `[{name, value}, ...]`
- **Lookup**: Returns a single entry or `null` if not found
- **Add**: Creates a new entry; fails if hostname already exists
- **Update**: Updates an existing entry; fails if hostname not found
- **Delete**: Deletes an entry by `name` presence; without `name`, deletes all entries in the book

**Delete-by-presence semantics:**

The `Delete` operation uses parameter presence, not boolean value. If `name` is present in the request (regardless of value), it selects deletion of that specific entry. If `name` is absent, it deletes all entries in the book.

### Compatibility SetSubscriptions

The `SetSubscriptions` method atomically replaces the subscription set.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `subscriptions` | array of strings | yes | Ordered list of subscription URLs |

Subscriptions are stored but **not fetched** by this API. Maximum 1000 subscriptions, 2048 bytes each.

### Compatibility SetConfig

The `SetConfig` method atomically replaces the address book configuration.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `config` | object | yes | String-keyed configuration map |

Configuration values are stored as inert strings. Path-like values perform no filesystem operations. Maximum 1000 entries, 256-byte keys, 4096-byte values.

## Address Books

| Book | Description |
|---|---|
| `private` | Private administrative book |
| `local` | Local administrative book |
| `router` | Router administrative book |
| `published` | Published administrative book |

Each book is independently persistent and isolated from the others.

## RouterInfo Selectors

The following selectors expose address-book state through the RouterInfo method:

| Selector | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `i2p.router.addressbook.private` | array | Private book entries |
| `i2p.router.addressbook.local` | array | Local book entries |
| `i2p.router.addressbook.router` | array | Router book entries |
| `i2p.router.addressbook.published` | array | Published book entries |
| `i2p.router.addressbook.private.list` | array | Canonical private book entries |
| `i2p.router.addressbook.local.list` | array | Canonical local book entries |
| `i2p.router.addressbook.router.list` | array | Canonical router book entries |
| `i2p.router.addressbook.published.list` | array | Canonical published book entries |
| `i2p.router.addressbook.subscriptions` | object | `{path, entries}`; `path` is `null` because Emissary has no path-backed subscription source |
| `i2p.router.addressbook.config` | object | `{path, entries}`; `path` is `null` because configuration metadata is not a file authority |

## Persistence

The runtime owner persists one complete state in the address-book source with:

- bounded JSON state;
- write/sync/rename publication;
- a last-known-good rollback copy;
- serialized mutation ownership.

The former I2PControl `addressbooks/` generations are migration input only.
They are imported once when no runtime state exists, with deterministic
collision failure, and are never used as a second authority or deleted
automatically.

## Security

- Authentication required for all operations
- No full destinations logged
- No subscription values logged
- No configuration values logged
- No filesystem paths derived from input
- Path-like configuration values are inert

## Runtime source map

| Source | Owner | Runtime role |
|---|---|---|
| Existing `addressbook/addresses` and destination files | `AddressBookManager` | Published downloaded source and compatibility lookup cache |
| Private/local/router/published control entries | Shared runtime `AddressBookHandle` | Durable administrative entries and normal lookup input |
| Subscription URLs | Runtime owner metadata | Stored only; `SetSubscriptions` never fetches synchronously |
| Configuration map | Runtime owner metadata | Non-operative metadata; request values never select files |

Startup constructs the runtime owner before Router and I2PControl composition.
I2PControl receives only its bounded handle; it cannot replace the resolver,
control downloading, cancel tasks, or write arbitrary paths.
