# ClientServicesInfo

Proposal 170 `ClientServicesInfo` method implementation in Emissary.

M027 independently revalidated the six direct selector keys and their exact
response shapes. Source and runtime availability remains selector-specific;
explicit `BOB: false` and unavailable-source errors are contract behavior, not
claims of an active service.

## Overview

`ClientServicesInfo` is an observation-only JSON-RPC method that returns
the runtime state of application-owned client services. The method is
registered in the M001 method registry and dispatched by
`emissary-cli/src/i2pcontrol/server.rs`.

The implementation is strictly passive: it observes proxies, listeners,
and session state without taking ownership, supervision, or control of
any service. No method invocation starts, stops, restarts, rebinds, or
reconfigures a service.

## Canonical request shape

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "ClientServicesInfo",
  "params": {
    "I2PTunnel": "",
    "SAM": ""
  }
}
```

The six exact keys (`I2PTunnel`, `HTTPProxy`, `SOCKS`, `SAM`, `BOB`, and
`I2CP`) are selected by direct parameter presence. Any JSON value selects the
service; only requested keys appear in the response.

The historical nested `Selector` boolean object remains a compatibility
extension. Direct and nested forms cannot be mixed.

Only the six exact selector keys listed below are accepted. Any other
key returns `INVALID_PARAMS`.

## Response shape

The response contains one entry per requested selector. Omitted
selectors do not appear in the response.

### `I2PTunnel`

Always returns an object with `client` and `server` keys. Each value is
a deterministic map of tunnel name to entry object (currently `{address}`,
optionally `{port}` for server tunnels). Empty when no definitions exist.

```json
{
  "I2PTunnel": {
    "client": {
      "my-client-tunnel": { "address": "abcd.b32.i2p" }
    },
    "server": {
      "my-server-tunnel": { "address": "host.b32.i2p", "port": 80 }
    }
  }
}
```

I2PTunnel inventory is queried from the shared `TunnelManagerControl` at
request time. It combines the already-parsed startup client/server tunnel
configuration with persisted control-plane definitions; startup entries are
marked `StartupManaged`, remain read-only, and are never copied into the
control-plane generation store. Successful control-plane mutations are visible
to the next ClientServicesInfo query without restart. Store failures and
missing address data propagate as JSON-RPC errors rather than empty or
fabricated inventory.

For client tunnels, `address` is the configured remote I2P destination. For
server tunnels, `address` is the destination returned by the running Yosemite
session. A server's local TCP target/listen host is never serialized as an I2P
address. A server entry is unavailable until its session has published an
actual destination, at which point the selector fails explicitly if no
contract-compatible address can be returned.

Unsupported definitions remain explicit configured/inactive administrative
definitions. If an unsupported definition has no actual I2P destination, this
selector returns an error rather than presenting an empty address or claiming
that the definition is active.

### `HTTPProxy`

Reports the HTTP proxy lifecycle.

```json
{
  "HTTPProxy": {
    "enabled": true,
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 4444
  }
}
```

`enabled: true` only after a successful bind (`Listening` state).
`Configured` and `Starting` states report `enabled: false` because no
listener has actually bound yet. When `Failed` or `Stopped`, the
response is `{enabled: false}`.

### `SOCKS`

Reports the SOCKS proxy lifecycle, same shape as `HTTPProxy`.

```json
{
  "SOCKS": {
    "enabled": true,
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 1080
  }
}
```

Same `enabled` semantics as HTTPProxy: only `Listening` reports
`enabled: true`.

### `SAM`

Reports the SAM bridge listener and session state.

```json
{
  "SAM": {
    "enabled": true,
    "sessions": {
      "chat": {
        "name": "chat",
        "address": "example.b32.i2p",
        "sockets": [
          { "type": 1, "peer": "127.0.0.1:7656" }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`enabled` reflects the actual bound TCP listener state. `Configured`
and `Starting` report `enabled: false`.

The session map is a bounded snapshot published by the canonical core
`SamServer`. It contains only active primary sessions. A zero-session map is
therefore a genuine observation; if the bounded source overflows or cannot
produce a complete snapshot, the request fails instead of returning a partial
or fabricated map. Socket `type` values follow i2pd's active SAM socket
vocabulary (`1` session, `2` stream, `3` acceptor), and `peer` is the accepted
TCP peer address.

If the listener is marked active but the canonical observation handle is not
available, the request returns an internal error rather than a successful empty
session map.

### `BOB`

Always returns the exact boolean `false` because Emissary does not
implement BOB. No BOB listener, stub server, port, or configuration
exists.

```json
{
  "BOB": false
}
```

### `I2CP`

Reports whether the core I2CP listener is bound.

```json
{
  "I2CP": { "enabled": true }
}
```

`enabled: true` means the core router bound a local I2CP listener
during startup and it remains active. `Configured` and `Starting`
report `enabled: false`. `enabled: false` also means I2CP was not
configured or the bind failed.

## Lifecycle states

Each proxy transition is recorded through a generation-fenced
[`ServiceUpdateHandle`]. The internal state vocabulary
(`Disabled`, `Configured`, `Starting`, `Listening`, `Failed`,
`Stopping`, `Stopped`) is private; the JSON-RPC layer maps these to the
exact Proposal 170 response shape.

### Configured vs. listening semantics

- `Configured` means the service exists in configuration and is being
  initialized, but is not yet listening on a bound address.
- `Starting` means the task has been spawned but `bind()` has not
  succeeded yet.
- `Listening` means the service has successfully bound a local
  address and is actively serving requests.
- Only `Listening` maps to `enabled: true` in the public response.
  `Configured` and `Starting` always map to `enabled: false`.
- After either proxy's `run()` future returns, the composition root publishes
  `Stopped`, so a successfully bound task cannot leave a stale enabled state.
- Proxy observer updates are generation-fenced; an exited task from an older
  generation cannot stop a replacement listener.
- For I2PTunnel, the response does not distinguish configured from
  listening — it returns the inventory regardless. Unsupported
  tunnel definitions never appear in a running state.

### SAM listener vs. session semantics

`SAM` reports two distinct things:

- Listener enabled: a bound TCP/UDP address on the configured port.
  This corresponds to `SamServer::tcp_local_address()` returning
  `Some(_)`.
- Active sessions: The core `SamServer` publishes a bounded, read-only
  metadata projection at activation and removal transitions. The I2PControl
  state receives only a clonable snapshot handle; no session handles, sockets,
  destinations, keys, payloads, or command channels cross the composition
  boundary.

### I2PTunnel shared inventory

The application maps startup configuration once, before I2PControl serves, and
passes the resulting read-only inventory to both production I2PControl and the
existing generic tunnel-manager composition. The handler queries
`TunnelManagerControl::list()` at request time. This ensures:

- Startup and control-plane definitions appear exactly once in deterministic
  name order
- Successful Create/Edit/Rename/Delete mutations are visible immediately
- Store failures propagate as JSON-RPC errors, not empty inventory
- Startup/control-plane name collisions fail closed at startup and cannot be
  created or renamed through the API
- Unsupported definitions appear in the inventory but never as
  active/running/listening

### I2PTunnel stub inactivity

Unsupported M004 backends (e.g., IRC, Streamr) report definitions but
never report runtime state. Their entries appear in the
`client`/`server` maps but never with active/running fields.

## Composition and wiring

The passive client-service registry lives at the heart of the
implementation. It is created in the application composition root
(`emissary-cli/src/main.rs`) and shared by `Arc` between:

- The I2PControl state (`I2pControlState::service_registry`),
- HTTP proxy spawn sites,
- SOCKS proxy spawn sites,
- I2CP listener snapshot from `Router::protocol_address_info()`,
- SAM listener snapshot from `Router::protocol_address_info()`.
- SAM session snapshots from the core-owned `SamSessionObservationHandle`.

The handler queries `TunnelManagerControl::list()` at request time for
I2PTunnel inventory rather than reading from the registry.

Producers in the composition root use `i2pcontrol::observers::*`
helpers to emit transition events through generation-fenced
`ServiceUpdateHandle` instances. Stale handles from previous startup
generations cannot overwrite current state.

The registry is independent of the UI layer. When I2PControl is
disabled, the registry and observers are not compiled. When the UI is
enabled, the registry behaves identically — no UI event/state is
consulted.

## Response bounds

Response size is bounded before dispatch:

- `MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES` = 1 MiB (estimated)
- `MAX_TUNNEL_INVENTORY` = 1000 combined startup/control-plane definitions
- `SAM_SESSION_OBSERVATION_LIMIT` = 1000 sessions
- `SAM_SOCKET_OBSERVATION_LIMIT` = 8 sockets per session

Complete results that exceed safe bounds fail explicitly with
`INTERNAL_ERROR` and are never silently truncated.

The core-owned SAM publisher uses an explicit `Complete`/`Incomplete` state.
When a session or socket briefly exceeds a public bound, or required peer
metadata is unavailable, the handle refuses partial data and retains the
bounded recovery record until the corresponding authoritative close/removal
event arrives. It then reconstructs a new complete generation only when every
currently active record is again within the public bounds. Recovery capacity is
finite and is not an event queue or a second SAM lifecycle registry; an
unrecoverable invariant failure remains unavailable rather than returning
stale or partial data.

## Failure and sanitization

Proxy failures are recorded as `Failed(SanitizedFailure)`. The
`SanitizedFailure` shape contains only:

- `error_kind` — short OS error kind name (e.g.,
  `"ConnectionRefused"`).
- `address` — optional socket address.

No credentials, private keys, complete configuration, internal paths,
or Rust backtraces are included. When the exact proposal response
shape has no failure-detail field (HTTPProxy/SOCKS/I2CP), the failure
is mapped to `{enabled: false}` and the sanitized detail is retained
internally only.

## No lifecycle control

The method never:

- Starts, stops, restarts, rebinds, or reconfigures a service.
- Consumes frontend or UI events.
- Parses log messages.
- Performs direct M004 persistence-file reads (the inventory is
  read via `TunnelManagerControl::list()` at request time).
- Returns SAM session private keys, destination material, or
  authentication data.

## Tests

Unit tests live alongside the implementation:

- `service_registry.rs` — registry semantics.
- `client_services.rs` — handler, selector dispatch, live tunnel
  query, and proxy enabled-state correctness.
- `observers.rs` — passive observer helpers.

Integration tests:

- `tests/client_services_integration.rs` — selector parsing,
  response shape, lifecycle observations, and concurrent registry
  updates.

Static guards:

- `tests/static_guards.rs` — M011 guards verifying no startup-only
  I2PTunnel population, no unconditional SAM sessions placeholder,
  Configured/Starting not reported as enabled, and handler uses
  live tunnel manager.
